# Scramble
This is a New York Times style game where the player creates three specific three letter words out of the scrambled letters in a grid. Every correct word turns green, the puzzle is solved when all three words are green

Each day all users get the same puzzle, which is retrived from an SQL database.

I made this project to learn about SQL databases as well as PHP.
